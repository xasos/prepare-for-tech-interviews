# prepare-for-tech-interviews
Tool to help you prepare for technical interviews. Code is based on the [Y-Combinator Interview Simulator](https://github.com/jamescun/iPG). I highly recommend reading through @cassidoo's [Getting a Gig Guide](https://github.com/cassidoo/getting-a-gig) when starting the process of looking for a job/internship.
